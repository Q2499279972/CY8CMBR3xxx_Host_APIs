* File Name: CY8CMBR3xxx_HostFunctions.h
*
* Version 1.00
*
* Description:
*   This file contains the declarations of the host-dependent, low-level APIs.
*
* Note:
*   These host-dependent Low Level APIs are provided as an example of
*   low level I2C read and write functions. This set of low level APIs are 
*   written for PSoC 4200/4100 devices and hence should be re-written
*   with equivalent host-dependent APIs from the respective IDEs, if the 
*   host design does not include PSoC 4200/4100 device.
* 
*   To use these APIs, the host should implement a working I2C communication
*   interface. This interface will be used by these APIs to communicate to the
*   CY8CMBR3xxx device.
*
*   For PSoC 4200/4100 devices, please ensure that you have created an instance 
*   of SCB component with I2C Master configuration. The component should be
*   named "SCB".

*   SRVS

*   MBR3 Design Guide
*   MBR3 Device Datasheet
*
* Hardware Dependency:
*   PSoC 4200 (Update this as per the host used)
*
* Code Tested With:
*   PSoC Creator 3.0 CP7
*   CY3280-MBR3 Evaluation Kit
*   CY8CKIT-042 Pioneer Kit
