* Function Name: CY8CMBR3xxx_ReadDiffCounts
********************************************************************************
*
* Summary:
*  This API reads the Difference counts of all sensors of the CY8CMBR3xxx 
*  device and updates the data to a buffer.
*
*  The API updates the buffer only if the sync counters of the device match. 
*  In case they donâ€™t, the API tries to read the data again. The maximum number
*  of read attempts is CY8CMBR3xxx_SYNC_COUNTER_MATCH_RETRY. You can set 
*  this value in CY8CMBR3xxx_APIs.h file.
*
* Parameters:
*  uint8 slaveAddress:
*   The I2C address of the CY8CMBR3xxx device. Valid range: 8 - 119
*
*  uint16 *differenceCounts:
*   Buffer to store the difference counts of all sensors. The buffer size 
*   should be equal to the number of sensors in the device.
*
* Return:
*  Status
*    Value                Description
*    TRUE                 Buffer was updated
*    FALSE                Buffer was not updated
