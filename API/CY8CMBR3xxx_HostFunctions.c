* Version 1.00
*
* Description:
*   This file contains the definitions of the low-level APIs. You may need to 
*   modify the content of these APIs to suit your host processor’s I2C 
*   implementation.
*
* Note:
*   These host-dependent Low Level APIs are provided as an example of
*   low level I2C read and write functions. This set of low level APIs are 
*   written for PSoC 4200/4100 devices and hence should be re-written
*   with equivalent host-dependent APIs from the respective IDEs, if the 
*   host design does not include PSoC 4200/4100 device.
* 
*   To use these APIs, the host should implement a working I2C communication
*   interface. This interface will be used by these APIs to communicate to the
*   CY8CMBR3xxx device.
*
*   For PSoC 4200/4100 devices, please ensure that you have created an instance 
*   of SCB component with I2C Master configuration. The component should be
*   named "SCB".

*
* Summary:
*  This API writes to the register map of the CY8CMBR3xxx device using the I2C 
*  communication protocol. The implementation is host processor dependent and 
*  you may need to update the API code to suit your host.
*
* Parameters:
*  uint8 slaveAddress:
*   The I2C address of the CY8CMBR3xxx device. Valid range: 8 - 119
*
*  uint8 *writeBuffer:
*   The buffer from which data is written to the device. 
*
*   The first element should always contain the location of the register 
*   of the device to write to. This value can be within 0 – 251.
*
*   Each successive element should contain the data to be written to that 
*   register and the successive registers. These elements can have a value 
*   between 0 – 255. The number of data bytes can be between 0 and 128.
*
*  uint8 numberOfBytes:
*   Number of bytes to be written, equal to the number of elements in the 
*   buffer (i.e. number of data bytes + 1)
*
* Pre:
*  The I2C interface should be enabled and working before this Low Level 
*  API can be called. Also make sure that the Global Interrupts are also
*  enabled (if required)
*
* Post:
*  N/A
*
* Return:
*  status
*    Value                Description
*    TRUE                 Write process was successful
*    FALSE                Write process was not successful
